Dear Mrinmayee,

I did not highlight this earlier because I initially thought it would not cause serious issues. Recently, I have been feeling dizzy and lethargic, so I visited my local doctor. They suggested I see a neurologist, who I visited today. The neurologist advised that I need surgery to remove the tumor and wants to keep me under observation for a month before taking any action.

Please find the attached latest medical documents.

Thank you for your understanding.
