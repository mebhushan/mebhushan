1. Confirm Desk-to-Patch Panel Connectivity
Ask the user to coordinate with the Siemens IT team.

Check if the user's desk port is properly cabled to a Patch Panel.

Without physical cabling, the LAN port cannot be activated.

2. Cabling from Patch Panel to Switch
Once the desk-to-patch panel connectivity is confirmed,

H&F Team will extend/patch a cable from the Patch Panel to a free port on the switch.

Ensure documentation of the cable number and patching details.

3. Mention the Business Need for the LAN Port
Record why the port is needed:

New employee?

Printer?

Additional device?

4. Determine the Device Type
Find out what device will connect:

Desktop, Laptop, Printer, VoIP Phone, etc.

Some devices might need special VLANs (e.g., VoIP).

5. Identify the Location
Capture exact location:

Building Name, Floor, Room Number, Desk Number.

Also, check if there is already a LAN port available nearby.

6. Verify Ethernet Cable Availability
Check if the user has a working LAN cable (Cat6 or Cat6a).

If not, inform that H&F team will supply and it may be billable.

7. Identify Switch & Switch Port
Use MAC address of the device to find where itâ€™s connected.

Commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
show mac address-table address <mac-address>
or using IAP tool if GUI is available.

8. Configure Switch Port
Configure VLAN as per requirement:

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/10
switchport access vlan 610
switchport mode access
spanning-tree portfast
Apply Port Security if needed (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
switchport port-security
switchport port-security maximum 2
switchport port-security violation restrict
9. Test New LAN Port
Ensure:

Device gets a correct IP Address (ping test gateway).

Device can access required applications.

No network drops.

10. Close the Request
Once everything is successful, update records (port info, MAC, IP details).

Inform the user and close the service request.
